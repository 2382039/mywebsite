                Hello, my name is <b>Loyar Agustina Purba,</b> I want to tell you about my holiday for more than a month, where I met my family in North Sumatra (Medan). I shouldn't have come back while I was studying at college, but because my sister got married I went home. <i>I'm leaving on 19 June 2024</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Because my sister lives around Parompong, we decided to go together to Medan. When we arrived at the airport, there was a slight problem, namely the flight time of the plane which was postponed several times. After 5 hours had passed, the plane we were on finally called, then we flew to Kualanamu airport and landed healthy and safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt a warm hug accompanied by gratitude for being able to meet them. As the days passed, there were ups and downs that I felt while in the field. However, one thing that makes me feel more happy is seeing them healthy and still with me in this world. It's nice to be able to joke, love and do many things with them. On July 29 2024 I returned to Bandung and arrived on July 31st
            </p>
